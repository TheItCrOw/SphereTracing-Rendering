# SphereTracing-Rendering
This is a repository for my journey to learn more about Sphere Tracing and the numerous possibilities it provides.

I will make a video about this topic, where I explain all about the implementation using: 
Unity3D Engine / Visual Studio / C# 
and also explain the theoretical Backbone of this project, which is primarily math.

Here are some impressions of which SphereTracing (if you can still call it that way after I modified it) is capable of.
More Impressions are in the "Screenshots" fodler found in this repository.
